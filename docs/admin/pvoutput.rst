Admin: PVOutput.org
===================

Make sure you have a PVOutput.org account, or `signup for an account <https://pvoutput.org/>`_.
You will have to configure your account and PV system(s). For any support doing that, please `see this page <https://pvoutput.org/help.html#overview-getting-started>`_ for more information.

In order to link DSMR-reader to your account, please write down the "API Key" and "System ID" from your PVOutput account. You can find them near the bottom of the "Settings" page in PVOutput.

    :target: ../static/faq/external_pvoutput_settings.png
    :alt: PVOutput account settings


Enter those values in DSMR-reader's admin pages, at "PVOutput: API configuration". Make sure to enter both:

    * API Key
    * System ID


.. image:: ../static/faq/pvoutput_api.png
    :target: ../static/faq/pvoutput_api.png
    :alt: API settings
    
    
Now navigate to another settings page in DSMR-reader: "PVOutput: "Add Status" configuration". 

    * Enable uploading the consumption.
    * Choose an interval between the uploads. You can configure this as well on the PVOutput's end, in Device Settings.
    * Optionally, choose an upload delay X (in minutes). If set, DSMR-reader will not use data of the past X minutes. 
    * Optionally, you can choose to enter a **processing delay in minutes** for PVOutput. Please note that PVOutput will only allow this when you have a **"Donation" account** on their website. If you do not have one, they will reject each API call you make, until you disable (clear) this option in DSMR-reader.

If you configured everything correctly, you should see some addional data in PVOutput listed under "Your Outputs" momentarily.
